## Description:
*Ballz & Booze* is a simple in-browser app that allows a user to find scheduled NBA games for specified dates, and allows them to find bars they can watch those games in with a simple city search. You sometimes have to jump through hoops just to relax with a cold beer and watch an NBA game: from over-priced streaming services or local network blackouts to your tv being on the fritz because your last NBA2K session got a little heated. *Ballz & Booze* can provide a user with two simple things: what NBA games are scheduled, and where are some bars to watch them in?
